# tridchessboard.js

tridchessboard.js is a JavaScript implementation of a Tri-Dimensional chessboard (from the StarTrek TV-series).

It depends on the [three.js] library and is heavily inspired by [chessboard.js] (its couterpart for regular chess).


## What does it do?

tridchessboard.js lets you do exactly what you are able to do with a physical Tri-D chessboard. Nothing more, nothing less.

That means you can:

* Move/capture pieces and tower-boards
* View the board from any angle
* Play by whichever set of rules you'd like

Additionally it provides you with an extensive API (modeled after that of [chessboard.js]).
This is great because...


## What does it **not** do?

tridchessboard.js does not:

* Know anything about the rules of Tri-D chess
* Do any move validation
* Keep track of who's turn it is


## Usage

* Quick start
